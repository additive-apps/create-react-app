## How to build/release

We currently only use the `react-scripts` package. To avoid building each package with lerna go into react-scripts package folder (`/packages/react-scripts`) and build/release that folder.

Use the command `npm login` to login into your NPM Account. After that you can publish the package with `npm publish`.

## To know

- This package must me public, otherwise it wont work
